# Formation Finder

A candlestick formation is a structure the price of a stock resembles over time. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_pattern)

A problem with stock trading strategies is that they loose effectivness over time. While many people use formations/patterns such as bullish engulfing and hammers, the statistical edge they use to have has almost completely disapeared! 

The purpose of this project is to create a program that systematically finds profitable formations using historical price data.

This is currently in development, more to come!

For now, here is my previous (failed) attempt: https://github.com/nicoloridulfo/FormationFinder. The README file is extensive and explains in detail how this works.
